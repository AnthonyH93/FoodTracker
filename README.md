# FoodTracker

First iOS app built in Xcode with storyboards utilizing MVC architecture.

Built from the following tutorial for practice:
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/ConnectTheUIToCode.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH22-SW1

This tutorial focused on all the major parts of a standard iOS app; basic UI, connecting UI to code, working with view controllers, implementing custom controls, defining data models, creating a table view, implementing navigation complete with edit and delete functionality and data persistance.

Some enhancements were made to the tutorial, these include; automatic scaling for meal images to support multiple device sizes, a button to add a new image to a meal and camera support for adding an image on a real device.

Below are some device screenshots of some of the app pages and main functionalities.
